# A React app that uses React 18's new renderToPipeableStream, hydrateRoot, Webpack and Babel.
## Got this set up during my free time xD
## Supported: Sass, SCSS, Typescript, CSS Modules and of course, SSR.
## I can't believe this thing evolved from an app created with NodeJS REPL into this...
## Note:
- JSX Runtime is already enabled.
- The first time you run `npm run dev`, it may not run properly. Wait for webpack to compile and restart the process :)
- You can try setting up HMR, I can't do that myself. For now, when you change your code, you gotta reload the page to see those changes.
- Oh, and, you gotta restart the process when you change your tsconfig.json too :(
